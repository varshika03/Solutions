Sequence (ai) of natural numbers is defined as follows:

   ai = bi (for i <= k)
   ai = c1ai-1 + c2ai-2 + ... + ckai-k (for i > k)

where bj and cj are given natural numbers for 1<=j<=k. Your task is to compute an for given n and output it modulo 109.

Input

On the first row there is the number C of test cases (equal to about 1000).
Each test contains four lines:

k - number of elements of (c) and (b) (1 <= k <= 10)
b1,...,bk - k natural numbers where 0 <= bj <= 109 separated by spaces
c1,...,ck - k natural numbers where 0 <= cj <= 109 separated by spaces
n - natural number (1 <= n <= 109)

Output

Exactly C lines, one for each test case: an modulo 10^9
